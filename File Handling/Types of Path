# Absolute File Path: Giving the complete path to the desired location
# E.g. C:\Users\dutta\PycharmProjects\file handling\my_file.txt

# Relative File Path: When you are in a working directory, you don't need to mention the entire path. You can just
# mention the file name E.g. .\my_file.txt

# . represents the current working directory and .. represents the parent or the previous directory

# you need to give proper file path else you can get FileNotFoundError
# in Mac each of the folder in path separated by / but in Windows it is \. So sometimes you can get confused

# so final concept:
# Absolute File Path is relative to the root of the computer
# Relative File Path is relative to the current working directory
